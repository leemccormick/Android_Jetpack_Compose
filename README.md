# Android Jetpack Compose : The Comprehensive Bootcamp By Paulo Dichone

Android Jetpack Compose is a new way of building modern android apps in android app development.

The Software Development industry is moving away from the Imperative Approach of building apps - where developers were required to write a lot of boilerplate code, navigate through inconsistent APIs, and hard to maintain code to build simple mobile apps.

With Jetpack Compose, building Native UI for the Android platform is more effortless, concise, consistent, and less code.

Jetpack Compose is the new modern toolkit that gives Android developers a simplified and accelerated way to build Native UIs on Android - with this toolkit; developers can build android apps with less code using Kotlin!

Jetpack Compose brings a paradigm shift in Android development - we now describe the UI instead of specifying the steps to build a UI. With Jetpack Compose, development time is accelerated as we can iterate fast with live previews while developing User Interfaces in Android Studio.

With Jetpack, creating slick animations and using Material Design is a breeze because the toolkit is powered by the Android platform APIs and intuitive Kotlin APIs.

This course brings you up-to-speed developing apps with Jetpack Compose and Kotlin.

I have learned from the basics of what a Composable function is to how to handle state in Compose, and how to build full-fledge android apps that leverage the full power of Jetpack Compose and Kotlin.
